Once the function swap the seq[start] with the seq[i] and calls the recursive function, at some point the recursive call will come to an end, and it will go back to original first call. The last 3 rows inside the 'for loop' are the one responsible to put the value inside the array in their original position before the next iteration of the foor loop. This process allow the for loop to modify the array starting from the original one on every iteration.\n",
